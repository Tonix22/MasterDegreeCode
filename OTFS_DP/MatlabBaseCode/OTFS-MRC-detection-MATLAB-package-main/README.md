**OTFS-MRC-detection-MATLAB-package**


Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) is a recently proposed modulation scheme that multiplexes information symbols in the delay-Doppler domain. The information symbols in OTFS experience a roughly flat fading channel even in high mobility wireless channels resulting in better performance than the widely used OFDM scheme, This code package presents the MATLAB package for OTFS detection based on the MRC scheme proposed in [R1,R2,R3]
